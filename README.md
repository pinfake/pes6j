Reverse engineered Pro Evolution Soccer 6 Server Emulator written in Java.

## Author notes
This is crap, untested, undocumented, unmaintainable code. 
It was coded at untimely hours in early mornings under the effects of alcohol and other substances.
All the crap you'll find inside comes from the process of guess, trial, error, blame, curse, repeat.
Using Java for this was the worst decision of my entire life, mostly about network coding.
Use it, if you can, at your own risk.

## Installation
Sorry, no installation instructions provided. Most probably won't ever be.

## Motivation
The reason behind all this was the official game publishers sudden decision to close online service. I felt like I had to give it a try, and it had to be done real FAST.
This project was dropped due to lack of interest, resources and time.
